# DBSCAN Clustering Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm.
DBSCAN is an unsupervised learning technique used to identify clusters of varying shapes and detect noise/outliers in data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Algorithm Used
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

## Files in the Repository
- `DBScan.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing DBSCAN implementation and visualization

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dbscan-clustering-analysis.git
